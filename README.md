<h2 align="left">React + Vite</h2>
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react] uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc] uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
